Reading club Neuro-Dynamic Programming by Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis

We will orchestrate a reading club based on the book Neuro-Dynamic Programming by Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis. The goal is to provide a focus for getting this book read and understood.

See the [book web](http://athenasc.com/ndpbook.html) site for the table of contents and **pointers to related literature**

You will need to be truly committed, as you are expected to:

- read the forthcoming chapter(s) every two weeks -- ???
- present one chapter yourself
    - slides? 

If you are interested in taking part, please send an email to [team@dropoutlabs.com](mailto:team@dropoutlabs.com) or fork+PR :-)
